# AlphaZero

In this repo we implement algorithms for learning how play certain games like TicTacToe, Connect4, Chess, Go, etc. We use reinforcement learning (RL), Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), simulation, and neural networks.

1. Create an environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (to deactivate just run `deactivate`)
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run simulation-based TicTacToe model: `python -m tictactoe-sim`
